Data-oriented astronomy

## Time-Domain Astronomy

* Change in electromagnetic emission over time
* Light curves: electromagnetic emission vs time plot
* Light curves belong to specific bandwidths of the spectrum

### Transient vs Variable Objects

* Variable: emission always changes over time, following a pattern
* Transient: emission only changes in a specific period of it's life

### Light Curves

* Problems: irregular sampling leading to missing data, noise due to atmosphere and instrument errors, multiple bandwidths

* Features are extracted from the light curves for ML
